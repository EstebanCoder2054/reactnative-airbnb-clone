Das Zimmer hat eine Schlafcouch, die f\u00fcr zwei Leute, die's kuschelig m\u00f6gen, ausreicht, Tisch, St\u00fchle und Regal sind vorhanden. Bettw\u00e4sche und Handt\u00fccher werden zur Verf\u00fcgung gestellt.  Selbstzubereitung von Kaffee oder Tee ist m\u00f6glich, mehr allerdings nicht.  Der Potsdamer Platz ist zu Fu\u00df zu erreichen, f\u00fcr das Brandenburger Tor und das Reichstagsgeb\u00e4ude besser mit dem Fahrrad. Zwei U-Bahn-, eine S-Bahn-Station und eine Bus/Nachtbushaltestelle sind binnen f\u00fcnf Minuten fu\u00dfl\u00e4ufig zu erreichen. Die Berliner Sehensw\u00fcrdigkeiten, wie zum Beispiel Brandenburger Tor,  Hackeschen H\u00f6fe, Reichstagsgeb\u00e4ude, Museumsinsel und vieles mehr erreicht man gut mit den \u00f6ffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln.

It was the beginning of an unpredictable and colorful life between two countries. After 3,5 years of my degree, I've decided to study a bit more - now I'm a guest student at the Ernst Busch University in Berlin for two semesters, I want to build it up here, what I've done in Budapest already. If I can work in Hungary as well - the situation is pretty difficult there -, I go back for some projects, but I'd like to perfect my German skills, watch the most interesting theatre directors and performances, enjoy the city, etc etc.\r\n\r\nI like: jazz, berliner techno, old things, Truman Capote, J. D. Salinger, my iPod, my wonderful friends, to write, to cook, to create, to think, to travel a lot, the decoration of my flat, my bike, water, coffee, talking to strangers, wonderful accidents, falling stars and my Moleskine diaries. \r\n\r\nI'm afraid of night butterflies and bugs (!!!!) and hate not enough to sleep.\r\n\r\nHm.

Although it has more and more tourists coming its still feels like a real neighbourhood, with many busy small streets full with all kinds of shops, from bakeries and biomarkets, to fashion, furniture, second hand clothing, record stores, etc. If your intention is to check the night scene Bargain and RAW is just around the corner. If you're looking for an easy going walking around the city, you'll surely enjoy Boxhagener Flee Market on Sundays and the food market on Saturdays, and the many many cafes, bars and little restaurants that are all around.",

Was in every continent but Antartica (!) So stayed in many hostels and loggings, met really lovely people all over the place and would like to think I could also be as helpful and giving as many others have been with me, so I very much enjoy being a host and feeling helpful. Also being in contact with travellers is always inspiring and theres something contagious about the excitement of a new place!\r\nI love music, art and culture in general, but a good meal or a nice nap in the sun can be a lot better than any theatre play masterpiece! So I think I really go for simple things.\r\nWhen I travel I like to take my time to enjoy the place, most of the time I find more inspiring to go to food markets or local places or meet nice people rather than stressing myself to go visit all the must see places.",

        "interaction": "I prefer to check in my guest personally but in the past I left the keys at some shop to let my guests step in to the apartment themselves. But there is at least one time that I introduce myself and the apartment. It's always nice to know who you're living with and to explain things that might be unclear. Most of the time the people that come have some questions that I am happy to answer or some other concerns that I try my best to help out with. Otherwise I'm always available either by my mobile phone when I'm not there or by talking to me in person when I'm in the house. I'm always happy to help out or have a nice chat about the day or anything ;) It depends on the guest that is staying at my place though. Some people have a lot of questions or need help in certain things. And sometimes it happens that my guest and I meet up in the kitchen so we chat. Maybe it becomes a nice conversation and that's what I appreciate. And some guests prefer to stay alone, enjoy their privacy or they a",

In 2007 I  travelled around australia and through some countries in asia for 16 months. Thats where I learned most of my english. \nBack in Berlin I started my work as a kinderagarden teacher until I was desperate to go traveling again. In 2012 I started Airbnb and hosting. I loved that experience straight away and each person that I had as my guest brought in a feeling of traveling that let my wish for traveling constantly grow. In 2014 I spent one year in New Zealand and it was a beautiful time out in the nature for a change after so many years living in The city. Since summer 2015 Im back home in Berlin. Now I'm back home refreshed with new ideas and inspired from my journey that is still very present in very good way. I'm working in the kindergarten again and I appreciate the time with the children. Spending my days with the kids is a lot of work but especially a lot of fun. \r\nIn my spare time I'm an active person (I love being outside riding the bike or spend time in the parks, meeting friends, listening to music, singing, playing piano and the guitar, or cook delicious food...)\r\nI grew up in Berlin and I know almost every corner here. I'm good for insider tips as well.",

For learning. I am quite addicted to this exchange of new people and experiences.  I travel on my own city often, trying to watch it as if I was a tourist, as the first time again.  \r\nI never had bad experiences traveling, and I believe is cause of the energy one projects . World is energy on movement and I enjoy going within it.\r\nMy best journey was walking alone \"El camino de santiago\"in Spain. India and Israel were also amazing-life-changing trips.  \r\nI was \"couchsourfer\" for a long time when I was younger and I host over 100 people for free in Spain and Germany, that gave me a lot of life-teaching, a lot of respect , and unfortunately also a bit of suspicion.",

Was in every continent but Antartica (!) So stayed in many hostels and loggings, met really lovely people all over the place and would like to think I could also be as helpful and giving as many others have been with me, so I very much enjoy being a host and feeling helpful. Also being in contact with travellers is always inspiring and theres something contagious about the excitement of a new place!\r\nI love music, art and culture in general, but a good meal or a nice nap in the sun can be a lot better than any theatre play masterpiece! So I think I really go for simple things.\r\nWhen I travel I like to take my time to enjoy the place, most of the time I find more inspiring to go to food markets or local places or meet nice people rather than stressing myself to go visit all the must see places.",

        "neighborhood_overview": "The apartment is located in the famous district Sch\u00f6neberg between U stations Wittenbergplatz and Nollendorfplatz. In the roaring 1920s, Sch\u00f6neberg was the neighbourhood of artists and musicians of Berlin. The neighbourhood around Nollendorfplatz in particular was known for elaborate parties and a casual lifestyle. To this day, modern clubs like Goya build on the atmosphere of that time. Winterfeldplatz, which hosts the city's largest food market on Wednesdays and Saturdays, lies directly to the south. Around the square and on nearby side streets, there are plenty of cafes and bars. Another Place of interest is Sch\u00f6neberg town hall. After the division of Germany, it was the political centre of West Berlin. This is where Kennedy uttered the famous words, 'ich bin ein Berliner'. To the south of the town hall, the long Rudolf-Wilde park is a good option for a leisurely stroll. Sch\u00f6neberg has a good connection to the neighbouring districts. The U-Bahn lines U1, U2, U3, U4 and U7 go through",
